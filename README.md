# Client Example

This application contains a gRPC and REST client for the example server.
Both clients share an interface so that they can be easily replaced.

The `main.swift` file calls these functions on the clients and provides already a few examples.

The idea of this example is described in the [README](https://github.com/Apodini/grpc-vapor-example) of the server.
